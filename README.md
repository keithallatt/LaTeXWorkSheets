# LaTeX Work Sheets

Create LaTeX based worksheets in Python! 

Any class inheriting the `LaTeXPiece` class (found in `problems.py`) can be added to a `TexDocument` object, 
adding functionality beyond simple problems. Create custom classes to add title pages or reference sheets,
additional problem sets, or example diagrams.
