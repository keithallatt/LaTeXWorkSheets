# LaTeX Work Sheets

Create LaTeX based worksheets in Python! 

Any class inheriting the `LaTeXPiece` class (found in `tex_code.py`) can be added to a `TexDocument` object, 
adding functionality beyond simple problems. Create custom classes to add title pages or reference sheets,
additional problem sets, or example diagrams.

This is similar to the JavaTex repo ([link](https://github.com/keithallatt/JavaTeX)), but is written in Python3.8,
and designed around creating mathematics worksheets.
